# SH-Code-Challenge
Supports Health Code Challenge Highlight Items Screen

A re-creation of an 'Activity' screen where the user picks three items they need to start a grocery list for the week. 
The goal is for the user to tap on the presented icons, and then have the selected icon become highlighted.

Extra requirements would be: 
to un-highlight icons by tapping it a second time, and re-highlighting / un-hightlighting per respective tap. 
to change the 'Next' button from a passive state to an active state once three icons are highlighted at the same time.
to prevent the highlighting of more than three icons at a time.
